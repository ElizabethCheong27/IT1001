              <p class="mb-0">Eatigo was conceived from a simple but ingenious idea that restaurants are empty at certain times of the day, or their locations may be hard to find. For restaurant owners, empty tables are a waste of resources as the staff still have to be paid. Eatigo allows them the opportunity to fill up their restaurants at such off-peak times, generating surpluses for the restaurant if they can provide up to 50% discounts so as to capture a greater market who probably have more time flexibility but less spending power (i.e. students)!
              <br><br>On the one hand, as a consumer, you get to eat out at nice restaurants at more affordable prices. Unlike other apps or food discount vouchers that come at a cost, Eatigo is a completely free mobile application so you can eat cheaper with no frills attached. On the other hand, the restaurant is fully utilizing its resources and having a crowd also draws new crowds in turn! Free advertising without the need for expensive ads! What an elegant solution for both the needs of restaurant owners and consumers!</p>
              <br><p>I personally use Eatigo every single time I go out to eat and receiving the discounts have never been an issue. The only sad thing would be that drinks and desserts are not included in most Eatigo discounts since only mains are discounted. The restaurant might also have their own Eatigo-specific menu so always call to check what the discount does not cover. Still, all the main dishes are usually discounted for at most of the restaurants so just try the app and enjoy a great meal for any occasion! The app helps you search for your ideal dinner place based on your budget, location, cuisine, etc. It's really easy to use!</p>
